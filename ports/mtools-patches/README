The following patches are relative to mtools-2.0 patchlevel 4.
They correct some minor bugs (flushing stdout) and allow you to work with
BIGDOS partitions.
It is also necessary
- to correct the wrong ctype.h (tolower/toupper)
- to change in include/linux/fs.h in struct buffer_head b_blocknr from
  unsigned short to unsigned int and recompile the kernel.

If you want the 'strange' floppy formats (see devices.c) you must also
apply the patches to kernel/blk_drv/floppy.c. Old ATARI-ST users might
lke that.
