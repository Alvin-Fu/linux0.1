As of Jan. 2, 1992:
Files used to implement lp support:

Status	New/Changed	Filename
mod	c		linux/kernel/chr_drv/Makefile
exp	n		linux/kernel/chr_drv/lp.c
not	n		linux/kernel/chr_drv/lp_ioctl.c
mod	c		linux/fs/char_dev.c
done	n		/dev/lp[0-2] ( c 6,0 - 6,2 )

Implementation:
Raw device only.
Only single print device tested, but code is designed to handle lp0 - lp2.
Returns out-of-paper as ENOSPC.
Returns offline as EFAULT.
Process-locked returns EBUSY.

Bugs:
No ioctl yet.
Process locking is fooled by pipes more than 1 indirection deep.
(This is so the printer will be locked by the lpd daemon automagically.)
Shell does not return errors, but keeps retrying.
