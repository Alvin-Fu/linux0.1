SVGA-mode patches to Linux kernel.

This patch will enable you to use all the alphanumeric modes supported by
your SVGA-card. It will do so by showing the modes available at boottime
and there you may select one of the modes or just boot as normal. If you
select a SVGA-mode the setup-routine will automatically inform main-init
of which resolution is chosen and set the TERM env. variable accordingly
in the shell. Therefore you must remove the entry in .profile that sets
TERM. Also you must include all the different termcap-entries from the file
termcap.add that your card supports, or why not include them all to spare
the time of sorting them :-)

These patches are applied to the appropriate files, and then the entrys
corresponding to your adapter in the contained termcap file must be added
to your termcap file. If you don't know what adapter you have, recompile the
kernel and look if the code can recognize your adapter, if it does it will
show (when asked to) the different modes available with the present adaper.
