Here is an an implementation of the select system call adapted 
for Linux 0.11.  I have done only rudimentary testing on it,
but decided to post it, not because I expect too many people will
want to use it immediately, but rather to get some feedback.

Unfortunately, there are no test programs included.
If someone wants to write some test programs, or better still,
knows where to get ahold of some already written, that would
be great.

Myself, I am still trying to size up pseudo ttys, and would 
rather devote time to that.

 
WARNING:  Both the VC patches and this one patch kernel/sched.c
But this shouldn't cause any problems.

How to use it:

  0) Backup your system

  1) move select.c to lib/

  2) move sel.c to fs/

  3) patch -p0 < sel.cdif

  4) remake

  5) reboot
