This patch enables screen blanking for Virtual Consoles with linux.

In effect, we get this for free, since VC already allocates a buffer
per console tty, one of which (the currently actives one) wasn't
being used anyways.  The blanker simply uses this buffer, and
copys blanks to the real screen buffer.

By default, blanking will be disabled at bootup time.  To enable it,
use 

  setterm -blank n


where n is a number between 0 and 60.  Setting it to zero disables
it again.  I usually use the number 10, meaning 10 minutes.

After applying the patches (same procedure as VC) just recompile.
Then patch setterm.c and recompile it and move it to /usr/local/bin.
Use the new startcons supplied, or modify your startcons to add 
-blank 10 to the first setterm.  Then reboot.

Also note that if you wish to use 50 line mode, you must now #define
VIDEO_VGA_50_LINE either in console.c, or in linux/config.h.
In 0.12, it will probably be defined in config, along with constants
to conditionally assemble setup.s with code for 50 line mode.

As noted, don't forget to change SYSSIZE to 0x3000 in build.c.


ISSUES:

You may need to be aware of the following 2 issues.

  1) setterm sets the interval by writing out an escape sequence
     to the console.  I do not know what all the valid sequences
     could be, so I selected one linux currently does not use.
     Namely "^[[Nl".  That is escape, open square, a number N
     between 0 and 60 and the lowercase letter L.  If some program
     later outputs this to your screen, the blank time will be changed.

  2) Blank is called by do_timer.  It is possible, that output could
     be going to the screen just as it is blanked, in which case
     characters could be lost (at least I hope that is the worst that
     could happen).  But since blanking usually only occurs during
     periods of console inactivity, the danger of this is low.
