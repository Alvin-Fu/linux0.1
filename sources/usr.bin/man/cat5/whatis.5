NAME
     whatis - list the available online manuals

SYNTAX
     /usr/man/whatis

DESCRIPTION
     Whatis contains a list of all the available  online  manuals
     in  the  manual  directory, and which section each manual is
     in. Each line in the file contains

     + the name(s) of the manual

     + the section it is in [in parentheses]

     + a minus sign

     + a short description about the manual

     Each manual name must contain no  whitespace,  and  have  no
     leading  whitespace.   These names must be separated by whi-
     tespace, commas, or both.   The  section  consists  of  open
     parenthesis,  single  digit  (plus optional single uppercase
     letter - to indicate subtype),  close  parenthesis,  and  is
     separated  from the name and description by whitespace.  The
     minus sign is used by _m_a_n(_1) and  thus  is  necessary!   The
     description  of  the manual is ignored, and can be anything.
     It may be multi-line, in  which  case  the  following  lines
     should be indented, and must not contain lone minus signs.

EXAMPLE
     whatis (5) - the entry for this manual

     man (1) - an entry for the manual program

     man (7) - an entry for the manual macros

     less (1L) - the less pager, which is not standard

for the
     string, strchr, strlen, strcat, strcpy (3)   -
              various C routines
             handling of strings.  These  are  all  kept  in  the
             _s_t_r_i_n_g._3 file in /_u_s_r/_m_a_n/_m_a_n_3 or /_u_s_r/_m_a_n/_c_a_t_3
