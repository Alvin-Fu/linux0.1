NAME
     uname - print system information

SYNOPSIS
     uname [-snrvma] [--sysname] [--nodename] [--release] [--ver-
     sion] [--machine] [--all]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of uname.   uname
     prints information about the machine and operating system it
     is run on.  If no options are given, uname acts as if the -_s
     option  were given.  If multiple options are given or the -_a
     option is given, the selected information is printed in  the
     order `snrvm' with a space between items.

  OPTIONS
     -_s, --_s_y_s_n_a_m_e
          Print the operating system name.

     -_n, --_n_o_d_e_n_a_m_e
          Print the machine's network node hostname.

     -_r, --_r_e_l_e_a_s_e
          Print the operating system release.

     -_v, --_v_e_r_s_i_o_n
          Print the operating system version.

     -_m, --_m_a_c_h_i_n_e
          Print the machine (hardware) type.

     -_a, --_a_l_l
          Print all of the above information.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
