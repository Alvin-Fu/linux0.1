NAME
     groups - print the groups a user is in

SYNOPSIS
     groups [username...]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  groups.
     groups  prints  the  names  of the supplementary groups that
     each given _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e, or the  current  process  if  none  are
     given,  is  in.   If  user names are given, the name of each
     user is printed before the list of that user's groups.

     The group lists are equivalent to the output of the  command
     `id -Gn'.
