NAME
     id - print real and effective UIDs and GIDs

SYNOPSIS
     id [-gnruG] [--group] [--name] [--real] [--user]  [--groups]
     [username]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of id.  id prints
     information  about the given user, or the process running it
     if no user is specified.  By default,  it  prints  the  real
     user  ID, real group ID, effective user ID if different from
     the real user ID, effective group ID if different  from  the
     real  group  ID, and supplemental group IDs.  It prints each
     of these values preceded by a string identifying it and fol-
     lowed   by   the   corresponding   user  or  group  name  in
     parentheses.

     The options cause id to print only part of the above  infor-
     mation.

  OPTIONS
     -_g, --_g_r_o_u_p
          Print only the group ID.

     -_n, --_n_a_m_e
          Print the user or group name instead of the ID  number.
          Requires -_u, -_g, or -_G.

     -_r, --_r_e_a_l
          Print the real, instead of effective, user or group ID.
          Requires -_u, -_g, or -_G.

     -_u, --_u_s_e_r
          Print only the user ID.

     -_G, --_g_r_o_u_p_s
          Print only the supplementary groups.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
