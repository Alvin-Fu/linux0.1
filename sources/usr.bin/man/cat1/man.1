NAME
     man - find & format online manuals

SYNTAX
     man [section] title

DESCRIPTION
     Man finds an online manual of the given  title,  formats  it
     (if  necessary), and displays it on the screen. If the title
     occurs in several sections of the online manuals,  the  sec-
     tion argument specifies which section.

     Man looks in the users environment for two  variables,  MAN-
     PATH  and PAGER. The first holds a list of directories where
     manuals are kept; directories  should  be  absolute  and  be
     separated  by spaces, tabs, or colons. It can be set up from
     shell like

     $ MANPATH="/usr/man /usr/local/man" ; export MANPATH

     If no MANPATH variable is found, man defaults to /_u_s_r/_m_a_n.

     The PAGER variable indicates which pager should be  used  to
     display  the  manual.  If  none  is  found,  man defaults to
     /_u_s_r/_l_o_c_a_l/_b_i_n/_l_e_s_s.

     Man searches through the _w_h_a_t_i_s file in each of  the  direc-
     tories  in  MANPATH  for an appropriate manual. This file is
     described in _w_h_a_t_i_s(_5). Man then looks for the manual  in  a
     _c_a_t_x  directory;  if  it  is there, man directly displays it
     with the pager. Otherwise,  nroff  is  used  to  format  the
     manual  from the _m_a_n_x directory, and the output is passed to
     the pager.

     If no manual is found in _w_h_a_t_i_s,  or  the  manual  does  not
     exist etc., man will give an error message and fail.

FILES
     /usr/man - usual directory for manuals

     /usr/man/whatis - file which lists all the manuals

     /usr/man/catx - directories of pre-nroffed manuals

     /usr/man/manx - directories of non-nroffed manuals
