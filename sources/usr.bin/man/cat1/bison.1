NAME
     bison - GNU Project parser generator (yacc replacement)

SYNOPSIS
     bison [ -dlvty ] file

DESCRIPTION
     _B_i_s_o_n is a parser generator in the  style  of  _y_a_c_c(1).   It
     should  be upwardly compatible with input files designed for
     _y_a_c_c.

     Input files should follow the _y_a_c_c convention of  ending  in
     ``.y''.   Unlike _y_a_c_c, the generated files do not have fixed
     names, but instead use the prefix of the  input  file.   For
     instance,  a  grammar  description  file named parse.y would
     produce the generated parser in a  file  named  parse.tab.c,
     instead of _y_a_c_c's y.tab.c.

     _B_i_s_o_n takes five optional flags.

     -d   Produce a .tab.h file, similar to _y_a_c_c's y.tab.h file.

     -l   Omit #line lines in the parser output file. Error  mes-
          sages  from the C compiler will then be associated with
          lines in the parser output file, instead  of  lines  in
          the original grammar file.

     -t   Turn on debugging. This option causes the _b_i_s_o_n  output
          to  have  debugging  code made available via the C pre-
          processor.  The external  variable  yydebug  should  be
          made  non-zero to have the debugging code actually pro-
          duce output.

     -v   Be verbose. Analogous to the same flag for _y_a_c_c.

     -y   Use fixed output file names. I.e., force the output  to
          be  in  files  y.tab.c, y.tab.h, and so on. This is for
          full _y_a_c_c compatibility.
