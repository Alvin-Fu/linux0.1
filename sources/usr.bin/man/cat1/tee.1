NAME
     tee - read from standard input and write to standard  output
     and files

SYNOPSIS
     tee [-ai] [--append] [--ignore-interrupts] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of tee.  The  tee
     command copies the standard input to the standard output and
     any files given as arguments.  If a file  being  written  to
     does  not  already  exist,  it  is created.  If a file being
     written to already exists, the data it previously  contained
     is overwritten unless the -_a option is used.

  OPTIONS
     -_a, --_a_p_p_e_n_d
          Append the standard input to  the  given  files  rather
          than overwriting them.

     -_i, --_i_g_n_o_r_e-_i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t_s
          Ignore interrupt signals.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
