NAME
     nice - run a program with modified scheduling priority

SYNOPSIS
     nice [-n adjustment] [-adjustment] [--adjustment=adjustment]
     [command [arg...]]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of nice.   If  no
     arguments  are  given,  nice  prints  the  current sheduling
     priority, which it  inherited.   Otherwise,  nice  runs  the
     given  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with its scheduling priority adjusted.  If no
     _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t is given, the priority of the command  is  incre-
     mented  by 10.  The superuser can specify a negative adjust-
     ment.  The priority can be adjusted by nice over  the  range
     of -20 (the highest priority) to 19 (the lowest).

  OPTIONS
     -_n _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t, -_a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t, --_a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t=_a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t
          Add _a_d_j_u_s_t_m_e_n_t instead of 10 to the command's priority.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
