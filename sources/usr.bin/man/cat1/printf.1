PRINTF(1L)        MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES         PRINTF(1L)



NAME
     printf - format and print data

SYNOPSIS
     printf format [argument...]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual  page  documents  the  GNU  version  of  printf.
     printf prints the _f_o_r_m_a_t string, interpreting `%' directives
     and `\' escapes in the same way as the C `printf'  function.
     It  interprets `\0ooo' as a an octal number (`ooo' is 0 to 3
     digits) specifying a character to print, and  `\xhhh'  as  a
     hexadecimal  number  (`hhh'  is  1 to 3 digits) specifying a
     character to print.  It  has  an  additional  escape,  `\c',
     which  causes  printf  to  produce no further output, and an
     additional directive, `%b', which prints its argument string
     with  `\' escapes interpreted the way they are in the _f_o_r_m_a_t
     string.
