NAME
     basename - strip directory and suffix from filenames

SYNOPSIS
     basename name [suffix]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of basename.  The
     basename command removes any leading path from _n_a_m_e; If _s_u_f_-
     _f_i_x is specified and is identical to the end of _n_a_m_e, it  is
     removed  from  _n_a_m_e  as well.  basename prints the resulting
     name on the standard output.
