DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of printenv.   If

     ment.  If one or more variable names are  given,  it  prints
     the  value of each one that is set, and nothing for each one
     that is not set.

     The exit status is:
     0 if all variables specified were found
     1 otherwise
