NAME
     xargs - build and execute command lines from standard input

SYNOPSIS
     xargs  [-0prtx]  [-e[eof-str]]  [-i[replace-str]]   [-l[max-
     lines]]  [-n max-args] [-s max-chars] [-P max-procs] [+null]
     [+eof[=eof-str]  [+replace[=replace-str]   [+max-lines[=max-
     lines]   [+interactive]  [+max-chars  max-chars]  [+verbose]
     [+exit] [+max-procs max-procs]  [+no-run-if-empty]  [command
     [initial-arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of xargs.   xargs
     reads arguments from the standard input, delimited by blanks
     (which can be protected with double or single  quotes  or  a
     backslash) or newlines, and executes the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d (default is
     /bin/echo) one or more times with any _i_n_i_t_i_a_l-_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s fol-
     lowed by arguments read from standard input.  Blank lines on
     the standard input are ignored.

     xargs exits with the following status:
     0 if it succeeds
     123 if any invocation of the command exited with status 1-125
     124 if the command exited with status 255
     125 if the command is killed by a signal
     126 if the command cannot be run
     127 if the command is not found
     1 if some other error occurred.

  OPTIONS
     +_n_u_l_l, -_0
          Input filenames are  terminated  by  a  null  character
          instead  of  by whitespace and the quotes and backslash
          are not special (every character is  taken  literally).
          However,  any  end  of file string is still recognized.
          Useful with the GNU find -print0 option when  filenames
          might contain white space, quote marks, or backslashes.

     +_e_o_f[=_e_o_f-_s_t_r], -_e[_e_o_f-_s_t_r]
          Set the end of file string to _e_o_f-_s_t_r.  (If the end  of
          file  string occurs as a line of input, the rest of the
          input is ignored.) If _e_o_f-_s_t_r is omitted, there  is  no
          end  of  file string.  If this option is not given, the
          end of file string defaults to "_".

     +_r_e_p_l_a_c_e[=_r_e_p_l_a_c_e-_s_t_r], -_i[_r_e_p_l_a_c_e-_s_t_r]
          Replace occurences of _r_e_p_l_a_c_e-_s_t_r in the initial  argu-
          ments   with   names  read  from  standard  input.   If
          _r_e_p_l_a_c_e-_s_t_r is omitted, it defaults to "{}"  (like  for
          `find  -exec').  Causes the command to be executed once
          per line of input.  Implies -_x.

     +_m_a_x-_l_i_n_e_s[=_m_a_x-_l_i_n_e_s], -_l[_m_a_x-_l_i_n_e_s]
          Use at most _m_a_x-_l_i_n_e_s nonblank input lines per  command
          line;  _m_a_x-_l_i_n_e_s  defaults  to  1 if omitted.  Trailing
          blanks cause an input line to be logically continued on
          the next input line.  Implies -_x.

     +_m_a_x-_a_r_g_s _m_a_x-_a_r_g_s, -_n _m_a_x-_a_r_g_s
          Use at most _m_a_x-_a_r_g_s arguments per command line.  Fewer
          than  _m_a_x-_a_r_g_s  arguments will be used if the size (see
          the -s option) is exceeded, unless  the  -x  option  is
          given, in which case xargs will exit.

     +_i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e, -_p
          Prompt the user about whether to run each command  line
          and  read  a line from the terminal.  Only run the com-
          mand line if the  response  starts  with  `y'  or  `Y'.
          Implies -_t.

     +_n_o-_r_u_n-_i_f-_e_m_p_t_y, -_r
          If the standard input does not contain  any  nonblanks,
          do  not  run the command.  Normally, the command is run
          once even if there is no input.

     +_m_a_x-_c_h_a_r_s _m_a_x-_c_h_a_r_s, -_s _m_a_x-_c_h_a_r_s
          Use at most  _m_a_x-_c_h_a_r_s  characters  per  command  line,
          including  the  command  and  initial  arguments.   The
          default is as large as possible.

     +_v_e_r_b_o_s_e, -_t
          Print the command line on  the  standard  error  output
          before executing it.

     +_e_x_i_t, -_x
          Exit if the size (see the -_s option) is exceeded.

     +_m_a_x-_p_r_o_c_s _m_a_x-_p_r_o_c_s, -_P _m_a_x-_p_r_o_c_s
          Run up to _m_a_x-_p_r_o_c_s processes at a time; the default is
          1.  If _m_a_x-_p_r_o_c_s is 0, xargs will run as many processes
          as possible at a time.  Use the -_n option with -_P; oth-
          erwise chances are that only one exec will be done.
