NAME
     tty - print the path of the terminal connected  to  standard
     input

SYNOPSIS
     tty [-s] [--silent] [--quiet]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the  GNU  version  of  tty.   tty
     prints  the  path  name of the tty connected to its standard
     input.  It prints `not a tty' if the standard input is not a
     tty. Its exit status is:
     0 if the standard input is a tty
     1 if the standard input is not a tty
     2 if given incorrect arguments

  OPTIONS
     -_s, --_s_i_l_e_n_t, --_q_u_i_e_t
          Print nothing; only return an exit status.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
