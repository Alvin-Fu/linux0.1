NAME
     pathchk - check whether pathnames are valid or portable

SYNOPSIS
     pathchk [-p] [--portability] path...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of pathchk.   For
     each  _p_a_t_h,  pathchk prints a message if any of these condi-
     tions are false:
     o+ all directories in _p_a_t_h have search (execute) permission
     o+ the length of _p_a_t_h <= the filesystem's maximum path length
     o+ the length of each directory in _p_a_t_h <=  the  filesystem's
     maximum file name legnth

     The exit status is:
     0 if all path names passed all of the tests,
     1 otherwise.

  OPTIONS
     -_p, --_p_o_r_t_a_b_i_l_i_t_y
          Instead of performing length checks on  the  underlying
          filesystem,  test  the  length  of the pathname and its
          components against the POSIX.1 minimum limits for  por-
          tability.   Also  check  that  the pathname contains no
          characters not in the portable filename character set.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as
     `--',  for compatibility with previous releases.  Eventually
     support for `+' will be removed, because it is  incompatible
     with the POSIX.2 standard.
