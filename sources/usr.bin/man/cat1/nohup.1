NAME
     nohup - run a command immume to hangups, with  output  to  a
     non-tty

SYNOPSIS
     nohup command [arg...]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of nohup.   nohup
     runs  the  given _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with hangup signals ignored and the
     scheduling priority increased by 5, so that the command  can
     continue  running  in  the background after you log out.  If
     the standard output is a tty, it and the standard error  are
     redirected   so   that   they   are  appended  to  the  file
     `nohup.out'; if that cannot be written to, they are appended
     to  the  file  `$HOME/nohup.out'.  If that cannot be written
     to, the command is not run.

     If nohup creates the file `nohup.out' or  `$HOME/nohup.out',
     it creates it with no access permissions for group or other.
     It does not change the permissions of those  files  if  they
     already existed.

     nohup does not automatically put the command it runs in  the
     background;  you must do that explicitly, by ending the com-
     mand line with an `&'.
