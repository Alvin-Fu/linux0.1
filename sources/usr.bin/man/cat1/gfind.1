NAME
     find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
     find [path...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version  of  find.   find
     searches the directory tree rooted at each given pathname by
     evaluating the given expression from left to right,  accord-
     ing  to  the  rules  of  precedence (see section OPERATORS),
     until the outcome is known (left hand  side  false  for  _a_n_d
     operations,  true  for  _o_r), at which point find moves on to
     the next pathname.

     The first argument that begins with `-', `(', `)',  `,',  or
     `!'  is  taken  to  be  the beginning of the expression; any
     arguments before it are paths to search, and  any  arguments
     after  it  are  the rest of the expression.  If no paths are
     given, the current directory is used.  If no  expression  is
     given, the expression `-print' is used.

     find exits with status 0 if all files are processed success-
     fully, greater than 0 if errors occur.

EXPRESSIONS
     The expression is made up of options (which  affect  overall
     operation rather than the processing of a specific file, and
     always return true), tests (which return  a  true  or  false
     value),  and  actions  (which have side effects and return a
     true or false value), all separated by operators.   -and  is
     assumed  where  the  operator is omitted.  If the expression
     contains no actions other than -prune, -print  is  performed
     on all files for which the expression is true.

  OPTIONS
     -daystart
          Measure times (for -amin, -atime, -cmin, -ctime, -mmin,
          and  -mtime)  from  the  beginning of today rather than
          from 24 hours ago.

     -depth
          Process each directory's contents before the  directory
          itself.

     -follow
          Dereference symbolic links.

     -maxdepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
          Descend at most _l_e_v_e_l_s (a non-negative integer)  levels
          of   directories  below  the  command  line  arguments.
          `-maxdepth 0' means only apply the tests and actions to

          the command line arguments.

     -mindepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
          Do not apply any tests or actions at levels  less  than
          _l_e_v_e_l_s  (a  non-negative integer).  `-mindepth 1' means
          process all files except the command line arguments.

     -version
          True; print find version number on standard error.

     -xdev
          True; don't descend directories on other filesystems.

  TESTS
     Numeric arguments can be specified as

     +_n   for greater than _n,

     -_n   for less than _n,

     _n    for exactly _n.

     -amin _n
          File was last accessed _n minutes ago.

     -anewer _f_i_l_e
          File was last accessed  more  recently  than  _f_i_l_e  was
          modified.  -anewer is affected by -follow only if -fol-
          low comes before -anewer on the command line.

     -atime _n
          File was last accessed _n*24 hours ago.

     -cmin _n
          File's status was last changed _n minutes ago.

     -cnewer _f_i_l_e
          File's status was last changed more recently than  _f_i_l_e
          was  modified.   -cnewer is affected by -follow only if
          -follow comes before -cnewer on the command line.

     -ctime _n
          File's status was last changed _n*24 hours ago.

     -empty
          File is empty and is either a regular file or a  direc-
          tory.

     -false
          Always false.

     -fstype _t_y_p_e

          File is on  a  filesystem  of  type  _t_y_p_e.   The  valid
          filesystem types vary among different versions of Unix;
          an  incomplete  list  of  filesystem  types  that   are
          accepted  on  some  version of Unix or another is: ufs,
          4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.

     -gid _n
          File's numeric group ID is _n.

     -group _g_n_a_m_e
          File belongs to group _g_n_a_m_e (numeric group ID allowed).

     -inum _n
          File has inode number _n.

     -links _n
          File has _n links.

     -lname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
          File is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pat-
          tern  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.   `*'  and `?' match `.' at the start of
          the link contents.  Slash characters  have  no  special
          meaning in the comparison.

     -mmin _n
          File's data was last modified _n minutes ago.

     -mtime _n
          File's data was last modified _n*24 hours ago.

     -name _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
          Base of path name (the path  with  the  leading  direc-
          tories removed) matches shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  `*' and
          `?' do not match `.' at the start of the filename.

     -newer _f_i_l_e
          File was modified more recently than _f_i_l_e.   -newer  is
          affected by -follow only if -follow comes before -newer
          on the command line.

     -nouser
          No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

     -nogroup
          No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

     -perm _m_o_d_e
          File's permission bits are exactly _m_o_d_e (octal or  sym-
          bolic).

     -perm -_m_o_d_e
          Permission bits _m_o_d_e are set for the file.

     -regex _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
          Pathname matches regular expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

     -size _n[ck]
          File uses _n 512-byte blocks (bytes if  `c'  follows  _n,
          kilobytes  if  `k' follows _n).  The size does not count
          indirect blocks, and does count blocks in sparse  files
          that are not actually allocated.

     -true
          Always true.

     -type _c
          File is of type _c:

          b    block (buffered) character

          c    character (unbuffered) character

          d    directory

          p    named pipe (FIFO)

          f    regular file

          l    symbolic link

          s    socket

     -uid _n
          File's numeric user ID is _n.

     -used _n
          File was last accessed _n days after its status was last
          changed.

     -user _u_n_a_m_e
          File is owned by user _u_n_a_m_e (numeric user ID allowed).

     -xtype _c
          The same as -type unless the file is a  symbolic  link.
          For symbolic links, if -follow has not been given, true
          if the file is a link to a file of type _c;  if  -follow
          has  been given, true if _c is `l'.  For symbolic links,
          -xtype checks the type of the file that -type does  not
          check.

  ACTIONS
     -exec _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
          Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d; true if 0  status  is  returned.   All
          following  arguments  to find are taken to be arguments
          to the command until an argument consisting of  `;'  is

          encountered.   The  string  `{}'  is  replaced  by  the
          current pathname being processed everywhere  it  occurs
          in  the  arguments  to the command.  Both of these con-
          structions might need to be escaped  (with  a  `\')  or
          quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.

     -fprint _f_i_l_e
          True; print the full pathname into file _f_i_l_e.  If  _f_i_l_e
          does  not  exist when find is run, it is created; if it
          does   exist,   it   is   truncated.    The   filenames
          ``/dev/stdout''  and  ``/dev/stderr''  are handled spe-
          cially; they refer to the standard output and  standard
          error output, respectively.

     -fprint0 _f_i_l_e
          True; like -print0 but write to _f_i_l_e like -fprint.

     -fprintf _f_i_l_e _f_o_r_m_a_t
          True; like -printf but write to _f_i_l_e like -fprint.

     -ok _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
          Like -exec but ask user first; if the response does not
          start  with  `y'  or  `Y',  do not run the command, and
          return false.

     -print
          True; print the full pathname on the  standard  output,
          followed by a newline.

     -print0
          True; print the full pathname on the  standard  output,
          followed  by  a  null character.  This allows filenames
          that contain newlines to be  correctly  interpreted  by
          programs that process the find output.

     -printf _f_o_r_m_a_t
          True; print _f_o_r_m_a_t on the standard output, interpreting
          `\'  escapes and `%' directives.  Field widths and pre-
          cisions can be specified as with the `printf'  C  func-
          tion.  The escapes and directives are:

          \a   Alarm bell.

          \b   Backspace.

          \c   Stop printing from this format immediately.

          \f   Form feed.

          \n   Newline.

          \r   Carriage return.

          A `\' character followed  by  any  other  character  is

          printed.

          %%   A literal percent sign.

          %a   File's last access time in the format returned  by
               the C `ctime' function.

          %A_k  File's last access time in the format specified by
               _k,  which  is  either `@' or a directive for the C
               `strftime' function.  The possible  values  for  _k
               are listed below; some of them might not be avail-
               able  on  all  systems,  due  to  differences   in
