NAME
     mkdir - make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-p] [-m mode] [+path] [+mode=mode] dir...

DESCRIPTION
     This manual page documents the GNU version of mkdir.   mkdir
     creates  a  directory with each given name.  By default, the
     mode of created directories is 0777 minus the  bits  set  in
     the umask.

  OPTIONS
     -_m, +_m_o_d_e _m_o_d_e
          Set the mode of created directories to _m_o_d_e,  which  is
          symbolic  as  in  chmod  and uses the default mode as a
          point of departure.

     -_p, +_p_a_t_h
          Ensure that each given path exists.  Make  any  missing
          parent  directories  for  each argument.  Parent direc-
          tories default to the umask modified by `u+wx'.  Do not
          consider  an  argument directory that already exists to
          be an error.
