X
X     NAME
X          mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags
X
X     SYNOPSIS
X          mattrib [ -a|+a ] [ -h|+h ] [ -r|+r ] [ -s|+s ] msdosfile
X          [ msdosfiles... ]
X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mattrib will add attribute flags to an MSDOS file (with the
X          '+' operator) or remove attribute flags (with the '-'
X          operator).
X
X          Mattrib will allow the following command line options:
X
X          a    Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indicate
X               a new file.
X
X          r    Read-only bit.  Used to indicate a read-only file.
X               Files with this bit set cannot be erased by DEL.
X               However, mdel is more cunning.
X
X          s    System bit.  Used by MSDOS to indicate a operating
X               system file.
X
X          h    Hidden bit.  Used to make files hidden from DIR.
X               However, mdir is more cunning.
X
X          MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
X          or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
X          will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
X          them from the shell.
X
X          The mcd command may be used to establish the device and the
X          current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
X          default is A:/.
X
X     SEE ALSO
X          mcd(1)
X
X     BUGS
X          Most versions of ATTRIB don't allow this many options.

X
X     NAME
X          mcd - change MSDOS directory
X
X     SYNOPSIS
X          mcd [ msdosdirectory ]
X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Without arguments, mcd will report the current device and
X          working directory.  Otherwise, mcd changes the current
X          device and current working directory relative to an MSDOS
X          filesystem.
X
X          The environmental variable MCWD may be used to locate the
X          file where the device and current working directory
X          information is stored.  The default is '$HOME/.mcwd'.
X          Information in this file is ignored if the file is more
X          than 6 hours old.
X
X          MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
X          or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
X          will require the directory name to be enclosed in quotes to
X          protect it from the shell.
X
X     SEE ALSO
X          mdir(1)
X
X     BUGS
X          MSDOS doesn't use CD to change to another device.
X
X          It may be wise to remove old .mcwd files at logout.

X
X     NAME
X          mcopy - copy MSDOS files to/from Unix
X
X     SYNOPSIS
X          mcopy [ -tnvm ] sourcefile targetfile
X
X          mcopy [ -tnvm ] sourcefile [ sourcefiles... ] targetdirectory
X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mcopy copies the specified file to the named file, or copies
X          multiple files to the named directory.  The source and target
X          can be either Unix or MSDOS files.
X
X          The use of a drive letter designation on the MSDOS files,
X          'a:' for example, determines the direction of the transfer.
X          A missing drive designation implies a Unix file whose path
X          starts in the current directory
X
X          Mcopy will allow the following command line options:
X
X          t    Text file transfer.  Mcopy will translate incoming
X               carriage return/line feeds to line feeds.
X
X          n    No warning.  Mcopy will not warn the user when
X               overwriting an existing file.
X
X          v    Verbose mode.
X
X          m    Preserve the file modification time.
X
X          If the target file already exists, and the -n option is not
X          in effect, mcopy asks whether or not to overwrite the file.
X
X          MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
X          or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
X          will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
X          them from the shell.
X
X          The mcd command may be used to establish the device and the
X          current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
X          default is A:/.
X
X     SEE ALSO
X          mcd(1), mread(1), mwrite(1)
X
X     BUGS
X          Unlike MSDOS, the destination directory may not be omitted.
X
X          The '+' operator (append) from MSDOS is not supported.
X
X          No other Mtools command requires the use of a drive letter
X          designation on MSDOS files.

X          v    Verbose mode.  Echo the filenames as they are
X               processed.
X
X          Mdel will ask for verification prior to removing a read-only
X          file.
X

X          w    Wide output.  This option will print the filenames
X               across the page without displaying the file size or
X               creation date.
X
X          An error occurs if a component of the path is not a

X
X     NAME
X          mformat - add an MSDOS filesystem to a low-level formatted

X
X     SYNOPSIS
X          mformat [ -t tracks ] [ -h heads ] [ -s sectors ] [ -l
X          volume label ] drive:
X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mformat adds a minimal MSDOS filesystem (boot sector, FAT,
X          and root directory) to a diskette that has already been
X          formatted by a Unix low-level format.
X
X          The follow options are supported:
X
X          t    The number of tracks (not cylinders).
X
X          h    The number of heads (sides).
X
X          s    The number of sectors per track.
X
X          l    An optional volume label.
X
X          To format a diskette at a density other than the default,
X          you must supply (at least) those command line parameters
X          that are different from the the default.
X
X     SEE ALSO

X
X     NAME
X          mkmanifest - create a shell script to restore Unix filenames
X
X     SYNOPSIS
X          mkmanifest [ files ]
X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mkmanifest creates a shell script that will aid in the
X          restoration of Unix filenames that got clobbered by the
X          MSDOS filename restrictions.  MSDOS filenames are restricted
X          to 8 character names, 3 character extensions, upper case
X          only, no device names, and no illegal characters.
X
X          The mkmanifest program is compatible with the methods used
X          in pcomm, arc, and mtools to change perfectly good Unix
X          filenames to fit the MSDOS restrictions.
X
X     EXAMPLE
X          I want to copy the following Unix files to a MSDOS diskette
X          (using the mcopy command).
X
X               very_long_name
X               2.many.dots
X               illegal:
X               good.c
X               prn.dev
X               Capital
X
X          Mcopy will convert the names to:
X
X               very_lon
X               2xmany.dot
X               illegalx
X               good.c
X               xprn.dev
X               capital
X
X          The command:
X
X          mkmanifest very_long_name 2.many.dots illegal: good.c
X          prn.dev Capital > manifest
X
X          would produce the following:
X
X               mv very_lon very_long_name
X               mv 2xmany.dot 2.many.dots
X               mv illegalx illegal:
X               mv xprn.dev prn.dev
X               mv capital Capital
X
X          Notice that "good.c" did not require any conversion, so it
X          did not appear in the output.

X
X
X
X          Suppose I've copied these files from the diskette to another
X          Unix system, and I now want the files back to their original
X          names.  If the file "manifest" (the output captured above)
X          was sent along with those files, it could be used to convert
X          the filenames.

X
X     SYNOPSIS

X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mlabel displays the current volume label, if present, and
X          prompts the user for a new volume label.  To delete an
X          existing volume label, press return at the prompt.
X
X          Mlabel will allow the following command line option:
X
X          v    Verbose mode.  Display the new volume label if the
X               label supplied is invalid.
X
X          Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS volume
X          label.  If an invalid label is specified, mlabel will change
X          the label (and display the new label if the verbose mode is
X          set).

X
X     SYNOPSIS

X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mmd makes a new directory on an MSDOS filesystem.
X
X          Mmd will allow the following command line option:
X
X          v    Verbose mode.  Display the new directory name if the
X               name supplied is invalid.
X
X          Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS directory
X          name.  If an invalid name is specified, mmd will change the
X          name (and display the new name if the verbose mode is set).
X
X          An error occurs if the directory already exists.
X
X          MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
X          or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
X          will require the directory name to be enclosed in quotes to
X          protect it from the shell.
X
X          The mcd command may be used to establish the device and the
X          current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
X          default is A:/.

X
X     SYNOPSIS

X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mrd removes a directory from an MSDOS filesystem.
X
X          An error occurs if the directory is not empty.
X
X          MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
X          or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
X          will require the directory name to be enclosed in quotes to
X          protect it from the shell.
X
X          The mcd command may be used to establish the device and the
X          current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
X          default is A:/.

X
X          mread [ -tnm ] msdosfile [ msdosfiles... ] unixdirectory
X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          In the first form, mread copies the specified MSDOS file to

X          multiple MSDOS files to the named Unix directory.
X
X          Mread will allow the following command line options:
X
X          t    Text file transfer.  Mread will translate incoming
X               carriage return/line feeds to line feeds.
X
X          n    No warning.  Mread will not warn the user when
X               overwriting an existing file.
X
X          m    Preserve the file modification times.
X
X          If the target file already exists, and the -n option is not
X          in effect, mread asks whether or not to overwrite the file.
X
X          MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
X          or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards

X     NAME
X          mren - rename an existing MSDOS file
X
X     SYNOPSIS
X          mren [ -v ] sourcefile targetfile
X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mren renames an existing file on an MSDOS filesystem.
X
X          Mren will allow the following command line option:
X
X          v    Verbose mode.  Display the new filename if the name
X               supplied is invalid.
X
X          Reasonable care is taken to create a valid MSDOS filename.
X          If an invalid MSDOS target name is specified, mren will
X          change the name (and prompt the user to accept or reject the
X          new name if the verbose mode is set).
X
X          The path component of the target filename (if supplied) is
X          ignored.  In other words, you may not use mren to move a
X          file from one subdirectory to another.
X
X          Mren may be used to rename directories.
X
X          MSDOS subdirectory names are supported with either the '/'
X          or '\' separator.  The use of the '\' separator or wildcards
X          will require the names to be enclosed in quotes to protect
X          them from the shell.
X
X          The mcd command may be used to establish the device and the
X          current working directory (relative to MSDOS), otherwise the
X          default is A:/.

X
X     NAME
X          Mtools - a collection of tools for manipulating MSDOS files
X
X     SYNOPSIS
X          mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags
X          mcd - change MSDOS directory
X          mcopy - copy MSDOS files to/from Unix
X          mdel - delete an MSDOS file
X          mdir - display an MSDOS directory
X          mformat - add an MSDOS filesystem to a low-level formatted diskette
X          mlabel - make an MSDOS volume label
X          mmd - make an MSDOS subdirectory
X          mrd - remove an MSDOS subdirectory
X          mread - low level read (copy) an MSDOS file to Unix
X          mren - rename an existing MSDOS file
X          mtype - display contents of an MSDOS file
X          mwrite - low level write (copy) a Unix file to MSDOS
X
X     DESCRIPTION
X          Mtools is a public domain collection of programs to allow
X          Unix systems to read, write, and manipulate files on an
X          MSDOS filesystem (typically a diskette).  Each program
X          attempts to emulate the MSDOS equivalent command as closely
X          as practical.
X
X          MSDOS filenames are optionally composed of a drive letter
X          followed by a colon, a subdirectory, and a filename.
X          Subdirectory names can use either the '/' or '\' separator.
X          The use of the '\' separator or wildcards will require the
X          names to be enclosed in quotes to protect them from the
X          shell.
X
X          The regular expression "pattern matching" routines follow
X          the Unix-style rules.  For example, '*' matches all MSDOS
X          files in lieu of '*.*'.  The archive, hidden, read-only and
X          system attribute bits are ignored during pattern matching.
X
X          All options use the '-' (minus) flag, not '/' as you'd
X          expect in MSDOS.
X
X          The mcd command is used to establish the device and the
X          current working directory (relative to the MSDOS
X          filesystem), otherwise the default is assumed to be A:/.
